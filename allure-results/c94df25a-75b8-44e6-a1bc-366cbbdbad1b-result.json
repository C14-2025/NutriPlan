Cypress tried to locate elements based on this query:\n\n> cy.get(#email)\n\nWe initially found matching element(s), but while waiting for them to become actionable, they disappeared from the page. Common situations why this happens:\n  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously\n  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element\n\nYou can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:\n\n> `cy.get('button').click().click()`\n\nto\n\n> `cy.get('button').as('btn').click()`\n> `cy.get('@btn').click()`\n    at retryActionability (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:113378:74)\n    at tryCatcher (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:1807:23)\n    at Promise.attempt.Promise.try (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:4315:29)\nFrom previous event:\n    at Promise.longStackTracesCaptureStackTrace [as _captureStackTrace] (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:3486:19)\n    at Promise.attempt.Promise.try (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:4305:9)\n    at whenStable (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:143797:68)\n    at <unknown> (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:143738:14)\n    at tryCatcher (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:1807:23)\n    at Promise._settlePromiseFromHandler (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:1519:31)\n    at Promise._settlePromise (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:1576:18)\n    at Promise._settlePromise0 (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:1621:10)\n    at Promise._settlePromises (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:1701:18)\n    at Promise._fulfill (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:1645:18)\n    at <unknown> (http://localhost:5173/__cypress/runner/cypress_runner.js:5450:46)\nFrom Your Spec Code:\n    at Context.eval (webpack:///./cypress/e2e/testesDashboard.cy.js:37:21)"},"stage":"finished","steps":[],"attachments":[],"parameters":[],"labels":[{"name":"language","value":"javascript"},{"name":"framework","value":"cypress"},{"name":"parentSuite","value":"NutritionDashboard UI Tests"},{"name":"host","value":"DESKTOP-LLDL7NA"},{"name":"thread","value":"pid-560-worker-main"},{"name":"package","value":"cypress.e2e.testesDashboard.cy.js"}],"links":[],"start":1764643068167,"fullName":"cypress/e2e/testesDashboard.cy.js#NutritionDashboard UI Tests Deve renderizar o gráfico de linha com dados semanais","titlePath":["cypress","e2e","testesDashboard.cy.js","NutritionDashboard UI Tests"],"testCaseId":"4906c7c5497fe6705a5661c93da73fea","stop":1764643068194}
